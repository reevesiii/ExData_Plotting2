## 5. How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?

library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")

## Use dplyr to filter with grep for vehicles
vehiclesData <- classCodes %>% 
                filter(grepl("vehicles", SCC.Level.Two, ignore.case=TRUE)) %>% 
                select(SCC) 

## Use dplyr to filter for Baltimore City
emissionsDataFiltered <- emissionsData %>% 
                         filter(fips == "24510")

## Use dplyr join the filtered types to the vehicles data set
joinData <- inner_join(vehiclesData, emissionsDataFiltered, by="SCC")

## Use dplyr to group by and summarise.
graphData <- joinData %>% 
             group_by(year) %>% 
             summarise(total = sum(Emissions))
